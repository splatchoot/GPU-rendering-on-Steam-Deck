# ***I need help for researches, here's the list of what i need help with:***

- [ ] Researching infos about the term "**MSA**", it stands for "**Heterogeneous System Architecture**", but i need to know what version is compatible with the steam deck, or what MSA version corresponds to the steam deck
- [ ] Researching infos on "**rprblender**", whatever you can find
- [ ] Researching whatever you can on why the steam deck's GPU crash when rendering Caustics and Volumetrics, or when you get it to work, why there are huge artifacts appearing
- [ ] Researching what rendering engine would be the best for the Steam deck's GPU/APU, that's the task i'm currently on
